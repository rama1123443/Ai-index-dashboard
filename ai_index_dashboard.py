This dashboard provides an interactive way to explore AI readiness across 62 countries.
It uses six key dimensions: Talent, Infrastructure, Research, Development, Government Strategy, and Commercial Use.
The goal is to help users compare countries and regions based on their AI maturity.
You can use the filters on the left to explore specific regions and income groups, and all charts update instantly based on your selection.

    ### Key Conclusions:

    - Top Adopters: USA, China, and the UK lead in Total Score and Commercial AI use.
    - AI Readiness is Uneven: Most countries still fall below a readiness score of 60.
    - Government Strategy Matters: Strong policies help, but without execution they are ineffective.

    ### Strategic Recommendations:

    1. Strengthen National AI Policies  
       Especially in low-scoring regions, governments should develop or refine national AI strategies.

    2. Bridge Research-to-Business Gaps  
       Encourage industry adoption of academic research to improve commercial scores.

    3. Invest in Talent Development  
       Focus on STEM education, workforce training, and AI-specific programs.

    4. Strengthen Infrastructure  
       Build reliable digital infrastructure: data, computing, and connectivity layers.

    5. Translate Strategy into Action  
       Ensure national AI policies include clear timelines, KPIs, and implementation plans.

    6. Promote Research Collaboration  
       Support partnerships between universities, industries, and government to foster innovation.
